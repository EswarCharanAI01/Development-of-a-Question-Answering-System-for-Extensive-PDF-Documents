Unterscheidung between data lakehouse and data warehouse is a common topic of discussion in the data engineering community, as both are designed to store large amounts of structured and unstructured data.

It flits RIGHT BY US, as we MOVE INSIDE --INT. SPINNER.THE PILOT IS ASLEEP.  The Spinner on autopilot.  The MAP on the dash is abruptly interrupted by A CHIME.The pilot wakes.  Yawns.This is K.  You’d peg him for 30 if you didn’t know better.  Refined features, flawless skin.  Intelligent eyes that breathe in detail and exhale warmth.  Gifted with a grin that masks wry for earnest.SHAPES begin to coalesce ahead in the distance.  Revealing themselves to be PLASTIC GREENHOUSES.K’s eyes go hard at seeing a strange INSTALLATION ahead.K directs the Spinner towards...  EXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA.

Its bent wing hitting the center pole as it strikes 6 o’clock... creakCLACK... creakCLACK... creakCLACK... 1.The Spinner’s SHADOW rolls over the windmill.  Approaching --EXT. FARMHOUSE. DAY.Cement walls and corrugated tin roof.  An old school maybe.  Beside it a PLASTIC TENTED POOL.INT. TENTED POOL. DAY.Under a translucent dome.  A bull of a FARMER stands knee deep in a pool full of sludge, raking a nutrient rich solution.  Bio-reactors slowly filtered the fluid into vertical plasmid sacs that feed into LARGE BINS.The Farmer wears thick protective gear from head to toe.  Hood and goggles cover his face.  He takes up a handful of NEMATODES, pleased with his crop.  Looks up as --THE SPINNER SOARS OVERHEAD.The Farmer sets down his rake.EXT. FARMHOUSE.The Spinner lands in the open field behind the house, kicking up a PLUME of DUST that briefly obscures it.A small flitty HOVERCRAFT ejects itself from the back of the Spinner, A PILOTFISH.K emerges from the dust.  Whatever color his coat was, it’s brown now. K instructs with the Pilotfish with a gesture.  It TAKES OFF.K approaches the peeling-paint farmhouse.  ONE TREE in sight, a giant, DEAD, leafless thing.  A ghost of grandiosity, standing only thanks to a brace and wires staked down.INT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.K crosses creaking floors.  Looks around:  Kalsomined walls, pitted windows.  All old, but clean.  Someone takes pride.  Basic furniture, an UPRIGHT PIANO.  Otherwise EMPTY.  No decor, shelves BARE.K inspects the few items.  Sheet music for CHOPIN on the piano.  An aquarium in which COWSLIPS grow...A pot of something fragrant simmers on the stove...  K leans into the pot, sniffs deeply, when --HEAVY FOOTSTEPS come from outside.  Rattling the whole house.K re-lids the pot, as -- 2.EXT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUS.The Farmer approaches his home.  Air HISSES in at the unfastening of his MASK.  He eyes the Spinner parked beyond the tree. Sees the Pilotfish hovering above. Pulls a chain.  A DECONTAMINATION SHOWER rains over his suit, which he can now unsnap.This is SAPPER MORTON.  Weathered 60s.  A well-broken nose.  Yet he pulls from his belt satchel a set of dainty glasses.  INT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUSTHE DOOR OPENS.  Sapper steps in.  The floor creaks under his weight.He scans the room.  Empty.  Sapper moves to a sink where he violently scrubs his hands.  He does not yet see K.K leans from a shadow into the light.  A stranger, suddenly visible.  Briefly ominous.  An uncertain moment...K(polite)Hope you don’t mind me taking the liberty.  Wind’s a bit unkind out there.  I was careful not to track in any dirt.Sapper eyes K’s chummy posture. Dismisses any threat.SAPPERI do not mind dirt.  I do mind unannounced visits.  You police?KSapper Morton... Civic number NK680514?SAPPERI’m a farmer.K(genuinely interested)I saw that.  What do you farm?SAPPERThis is a protein farm.  Wallace design.Sapper fishes a clod off his boot and pulls off a single wriggling WORM.SAPPER (cont’d)It only takes the one to start.  Parthenogenic strain.  Constant doubling.  They’ll fill as much dirt as you can wet. 3.KIs that what I smell?K looks to that inviting pot on the stove.  Sapper shakes his head, pleased with himself.  Opens a cupboard, where a grow light nourishes PLANTS.  A few FLOWERS.  And a bottle terrarium full of GREEN SHOOTS.SAPPERGrow this just for me.  Garlic.KGarlic.He looks.  The pot on the stove bubbles and steams.SAPPERWhole town farmed it back once.  Smelled this good a hundred miles in circle.Try some?KNo thank you.  I prefer to keep a cold stomach until the hard part of the day’s behind me.  How long you been here?SAPPERSince ’20.  Came by it honest too if that’s what you’re after.KBut you weren’t a farmer prior.Sapper cocks his head at the comment.  K notes the SATCHEL at  his belt.K (cont’d)That bag... colonial medical use, isn’t it?  Military issue.  Heat resistant.  Where were you...  Calantha?  Must’ve been brutal.  Not many who survived bothered to come back to ground.A beat.  Sapper’s expression darkens.  He takes off his glasses puts them in his satchel.SAPPERPlanning on taking me in?  Huh?  Take a look inside.  See what they missed.REVEAL:  Sapper has A SCALPEL from his satchel.  Not likely.KIf taking you in is an option, I’d much prefer that over the alternative. 4.K puts his gun on the table.K (cont’d)You had to know it’d be someone in time.  Sorry it’s me.K stands and retrieves a small SCANNER from his pocket. SAPPERGood as any.K activates the scanner.KIf you’d look up and to the left please.The FIGHT is quick and it is fierce:Sapper stabs towards K’s heart.  K avoids the blade, only his coat and the wall are pierced by Sapper’s knife now stuck deep into the wall.  K breaks Sapper’s hold on the knife, which skids to the floor.K DUCKS a heavy fist that sinks into the wall where his head just was.  Sapper grabs K by his belt and collar, lifting him into the air and slamming him into the wall over and over -- until K’s body GOES THROUGH IT, and --K crashes onto the floor in the next room.K recovers quickly, strangely able to withstand the punishment.  He sees Sapper charge through the wall to finish the job.Sapper is on him -- a vice lock around K’s throat -- K gasping for air. K gets out of Sapper’s grip, and lashes out in rapid succession, his solar plexus, his chin, his throat, crushing his windpipe.  His blows are SURGICAL, anatomically precise, like viper bites.Sapper is stunned, choking, in pain.  K kicks Sappers’ knee and the giant drops to the floor like a felled oak tree.K SNATCHES Sapper’s THROAT -- SQUEEZING -- thumb SLIDING UPWARD as -- Sapper GASPS... FLAILS... hand reaching...For the dropped SCALPEL... GRASPING IT!HE STABS K in the SHOULDER.K accepts the wound and the pain.  Only squeezes tighter. 5.Sapper’s EYES ROLL BACK -- the desired effect -- REVEALING:  A PINPRICK OF COLOR on the underside of the right EYEBALL.K draws the SCANNER -- which reads the point like a bar code.  It confirms Sapper’s ID.K stops holding back -- SNAPS Sapper’s remaining good arm -- grabs his GUN that has fallen on the floor beside the table.K (cont’d)Please don’t get up.Sapper raises up still fighting for air.SAPPERHow does it feel, killing your own kind?KI don’t retire my own kind.  We don’t run.  Only old models run.SAPPERYou new models.  You’re happy scraping the shit.  You’ve never seen a miracle.Sapper gives a zealot’s grin.  Ready to die for a cause only he understands.  Eager for it.  HE RUSHES K.THE GUN THUNDERS.HOLD ON THE GUN.  So we only HEAR Sapper’s body DROP.K breathes heavy.  Checks his wound.  Sees his BLOOD on his FINGERS.Blood trickles onto fallen sheet music.  Staining Chopin.K smooths himself back to dignity.  Leans over the body.  Then PAUSES.  Crosses the room.  Finds a spoon.  Hesitates.Tastes the soup.  Hmmm.  Garlic.EXT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.K steps out.  Looks up at a sliver of sun eking through the dense clouds.  The Pilotfish is hovering above the farm.In one hand he holds SAPPER’S GLASSES.  In the other he holds a small, clear CASE.  INSIDE IS SAPPER’S EYE.  He staggers toward his Spinner.  Gestures to the Pilotfish.KPhotograph everything.The Pilotfish rises to take pictures of the farm. 6.INT. SPINNER.K taps a button on the dash.  An LAPD LOGO comes up.KMadam, please.ON SCREEN comes the perpetually disappointed face of LT. JOSHI.  A 50ish woman.  Ambitious, officious, impatient.  K’s backtalk gives fuel to her irritation so she tolerates it.  Or maybe she just likes the look of him.  More than she should.  She sees his BLOODY shoulder.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)You’re hurt.  I’m not paying for that.KI’ll glue it.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)And?In answer K holds up the CASE with SAPPER’S EYE.  The pinprick of his CODE below the cornea.  It SCANS.  Sapper’s SERIAL NUMBER and history open.  A NEXUS 8 for the curious.JOSHI (ON SCREEN) (cont’d)One of the tail end Nexus 8s before Prohibition.  Looks like he could take your head off.KHe thought about it.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)Field medic, standard ocular ID upgrades, open end lifespan, now ended.  He went AWOL after Calantha with a few more in his outfit I wouldn’t mind closing out.  Just him?MORE NEXUS 8 IDs flit by.  All wanting to be retired.KJust the one.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)Between the retirement and the bleed you’ll see a tidy bonus.  Less mine.KCan I get it today? 7.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)I don’t know what you all do with cash in pocket anyway.  Come on home for your baseline.Something catches K’s eye.  By that TREE.  Low to the ground.  The smallest pop of YELLOW... against a dirt brown world.KMoment, Madam.EXT. FARMHOUSE.He kneels at the foot of the tree to find:A SINGLE, SLENDER COWSLIP.  Left leaning against a root.K lifts it to his eye.  As if moved by its delicacy.  He considers the long dead tree.  Gestures to the Pilotfish --KThere.  30 meters to maximum depth.The Pilotfish begins a spiral over the area.ON THE SCREEN:  An ULTRASOUND of the ground below.  Root systems.  A cracked foundation.  And there, buried DEEP under the tree...  A SMALL SEALED SQUARE FOOTLOCKER.Joshi sees it in her office as well.  Annoyed at more work.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)What is that?KIt’s down in deep.  Send a dig team, Madam?Joshi SIGHS, annoyed.K (cont’d)Should I find a shovel, spare your night?JOSHI (ON SCREEN)(yes, but...)You better get back ahead of the storm.The Pilotfish attaches itself to the spinner as it takes off.Camera moves toward the tree as we --CUT TO: 8.EXT. SKIES ABOVE LOS ANGELES. NIGHT.LIGHTNING shatters the sky into irregular jigsaw shapes.  Indeed, there is a storm collecting to the north.  We are...SOARING OVERThe breathtaking cityscape skyline of dystopian grime.  30 years older.  Sweatier.  Sucked of oxygen.  If LA then was a giant oil refinery then, now it is industrial bones jutting out of a new city built atop the old.  And spread far as the eye can see.  What were streets are canyons that cut deep down to the strata below.  Who knows how far.K’S SPINNERIs a single bulb in the Christmas tree.  Part of the SPINNER TRAFFIC that lights up the sky.  Now gliding for the city’s poorer, uglier center.  A seizure of ADVERTISEMENT, interactive and bright.  In the distance is a massive structure:  THE SEPULVEDA SEAWALL.INTERVIEWER (O.S.)Subject:  Officer K D6-dash-3-dot-7.  Let’s begin.  Ready?K (O.S.)Yes, Sir.INTERVIEWER (O.S.)Recite your baseline.We see K through his rain streaked windshield as the Spinner banks and begins its descent toward a grey cinder block of a building.  RUNNING LIGHTS illuminate a LANDING PAD at the top of the LAPD TOWER / DIVISION 5.K (O.S.)“And blood-black nothingness began to spin / A system of cells interlinked within / Cells interlinked within cells interlinked / Within one stem.”INT. POLICE STATION. PROCESSING HALL. NIGHT.Lifeless architecture.  Huge, with worn out plastic features.  Call it functional to be nice.Though it is late it is CROWDED.  Bloody-nosed K walks through a chaotic hive of crime processing.  CRIMINALS pleading cases at plexi-covered booths...  or shouting into payport phone banks...The HUMAN COPS still manage to get in K’s way, sure to remind him of his place and esteem as a Replicant. 9.COPFuck off, Skinjob.If that bothers K he does not let on.K (O.S.)“And dreadfully distinct / Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.”INT. INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.A clinical room that was white a decade ago maybe.  The INTERVIEWER can be heard but not seen.The long barrelled LENS of a specialized CAMERA slides back and forth to find its specific focus on K, who sits on a stool.  Coat off and on his lap.  Dry blood on his cut shirt.  He stares ahead at the camera.  Compliant and still.The CAMERA alters its focus accusingly.  Locks in.INTERVIEWER (O.S.)(sudden and forceful)Cells.KCells.INTERVIEWER (O.S.)Have you ever been in an institution?  Cells.KCells.INTERVIEWER (O.S.)Do they keep you in a cell.

A small ADVERTISEMENT DRONE hovers like an insect, projecting 3D ads in the smoggy atmosphere.  A HUGE SNOW MELTING MACHINE moves down the street, clearing the slush.  It passes to REVEAL --K.  He pushes past the occlusion of PEOPLE buttoned against the cold.  Crosses the windblown street.  Gutters heaped with dirty snow as more dirty snow falls.  Fat, sooty flakes.He carries a newly purchased PACKAGE under his arm.EXT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEXA grand, old office building.  TILT DOWN the building’s facade as K enters...INT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX.The office building has been hastily and cheaply retrofitted for residential living.  DENSELY crowded with FAMILY LIFE.The many RESIDENTS, too poor or genetically problematic to get Off-World, treat the halls and stairway landings like a dorm commons.  An extension of their own homes.Pungent signs of ethnicity everywhere.  Colors, carpets, clothes.  As many languages as shades of skin.  K gives a nod of acknowledgment to a man smoking in the hall.  Is acknowledged back with a stream of foreign epithets that follow him up...INT. K’S APARTMENT COMPLEX. CONTINUED.FIND K ON THE STAIRS 12.Walking up 80 stories.  Stiff from the fight.  An OLD WOMAN bumps into him, expecting him to get out of her way.  No one he passes the least glad to see a Replicant.INT. HALLWAY.K crosses the hall.  ALL his NEIGHBORS’ DOORS are open like market stalls letting in air and letting out CHILDREN.  Every home thickly filled, like a hoarder’s garage.  Some host SHOPS.  FOOD STALLS.  Every floor like a town square.K walks past and to his apartment.  A BOY, brown-faced, missing an ear, looking up at K, with curiosity and fear.  K opens the lock.  Disappears inside.  The only one to close his door, which is tagged with a GRAFFITI:  “FUCK OFF SKINNER.”EXT. K’S APARTMENT. NIGHT.PUSH IN ON K’S WINDOW, as a LIGHT turns on within...INT. K’S APARTMENT.A sparsely adorned space in clear contrast to his neighbors.  No pretense of cultural heritage.  A simple chair.  On its arm a valueless paperback novel, well-thumbed, noted, creased.  Nabokov’s maddening “PALE FIRE” as it happens, not that we make a thing of it.K walks in with his package, trying to be discreet, he hides it as...He turns on a CONSOLE.  Perhaps a MUSIC PLAYER, which spins a SINATRA song, “Summer Winds.”K takes off his coat.  Seems more annoyed at the scalpel tear in the fabric than the shoulder wound he sustained under it.WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)K!  I didn’t hear you.  You’re early!KYou want me to come back?JOI (O.S.)(a laugh)Go scrub.Just hearing it helps take away the pain.  K relaxes into this normal domestic scene. 13.INT. SHOWER.K washes off the day’s dust and blood.  Jets shower.  Five seconds of water.INT. BATHROOM.K at a mirror eyes his shoulder WOUND.JOI (O.S.)How was your meeting?He squeezes the contents of a thin nosed TUBE onto it.  Platelet jelly.  The skin rebonds.  Gluing it after all.KThe usual.  How was your day?JOI (O.S.)I’m getting cabin fever.INT. KITCHEN.K cooks in a corridor kitchen that looks like one we would find in a very old space station.  He cooks with dexterity, trying to be light, as he makes a prefab meal. KI had an accident at work.  Think I ruined my shirt.JOI (O.S.)I’m sure I can fix that for you.  Let me take a look at it.KYou want a drink first?  I need a drink.JOI (O.S.)Mmm-hmm.  Pour me one, will you.INT. K’S APARTMENT.K crosses in, pours two drinks.  Sits on a chair in the middle of the living room.  Neighbors at the window, a couple, on the other side of the street.  Ordinary life.JOI (O.S.)I’m trying a new recipe.  I think you’ll like it.KDon’t fuss. 14.JOI (O.S.)Too late.  I hope it isn’t dry.K plays at indignation but is glad for her thoughtfulness.  K’s life is not lonely and that is something in this world.K drinks the two drinks poured, sits to eat the meal he made.JOI (O.S.) (cont’d)Did you know this song was released in 1966 on Reprise Records?  It was number 1 on the charts...  Won’t be much longer.  Finishing touches.He opens a CASE.  Inside:  Five cigarettes.  A commodity.  He sets ONE onto an ashtray.  We hear CUTLERY gather.  We hear FOOTSTEPS.JOI (O.S.) (cont’d)Ok, ready!  I think you’ll like it.KI told you not to fuss.JOI (O.S.)And yet.REVEAL:  JOI.Not a real woman at all.  A digital companion.  PROJECTED from a hard line CONSOLE unit mounted on tracks along the ceiling, and restricting her existence to this space.  Goddess, girlfriend, geisha and, right now, goddamn bombshell.  Ingeniously real in every way except the one that counts.She holds a plate of steak frites.  Not real of course.  An illusion of satisfaction.  Just like Joi in her APRON over a sweater set and pearls.  Waiting for him with dinner on the table and drink in hand like a cartoon 60s housewife.(NOTE:  Joi cannot interact with physical objects.  Any “object” she manipulates is a holo representation, like her.  Nor does she move when unobserved by K; when he turns away for any length of time she shifts into idle animations.)JOI (cont’d)Voila.  Bon appetit.She sets the plate atop his sad prefab bowl of actual food.  Kisses him on the cheek.CLOSE ON:  HIS SKIN.  Brushed by the butterfly kiss of her cloud.  Palpable but not tangible. 15.JOI (cont’d)I missed you, babysweet.KHoney, it’s beautiful.JOIJust put your feet up.  Relax.K is moved by the gesture.  He puts the cigarette to his lips.  Joi leans in close.  Puts up a finger...  Juuuust teasingly touching the tip of the cigarette... until... a tiny STATIC SPARK ignites an ember.He draws, and his cigarette lights.  He blows the smoke into Joi, making her hologram all the more dense and real.They look at each other.  Joi studies him.  She looks to the shelf.  Notes Sapper’s glasses.JOI (cont’d)Was a day, huh?K(heavy)It was a day.Her form seamlessly reverts back to her lissome baseline.  Companionate, respectable, smart.  The way he likes her.  She “picks up” his copy of “Pale Fire,” hoping to cheer him up.JOIWould you read to me.  I’m dying to know what happens next.KYou hate that book.K smiles.  She throws the book behind her back.  The book disappears as it flies.JOII don’t want to read either.  Let’s dance.She straightens.  Arm up to receive his and be led, wearing now a beautiful dress.  And with that Joi wins.  K has no choice but to put his day behind him.JOI (cont’d)You wanna dance, or you wanna open your present? 16.JOI (cont’d)A present?Joi looks elated.JOI (cont’d)What’s the occasion?KOur anniversary.JOIIs it?K smiles.  Of course not.He opens the box on...  A DIGITAL DEVICE, size of a King Size Snickers.  Joi visibly brightens with excitement.KHappy Anniversary.JOIAn emanator.KWe don’t need a hard line anymore.  Try it on.K presses the console.  Joi hesitates only a moment then... FADES AWAY.A RESTART CHIME.  A LOGO floats off the emanator:  A SPHERE, surrounded by smaller spheres in orbit.  WALLACE CORP, E&C.K taps the emanator and, with a CHIME...  Joi comes back online.  THE EMANATOR conjures her even more realistically in every way.  She moves about, her image unbroken as it was when projected from the hard line.  She TWIRLS about, the pleats in the new dress conjured for the effect billow out.  She loves it.JOIOh thank you thank you thank you!KYou can go anywhere in the world.  What do you want to see first?Joi considers, eyes sparkling with an idea.  And we... 17.EXT. ROOFTOP. STORMING. NIGHT.ON JOI.  Rapt, eyes fixed on the gorgeous fractal skyline.  The rain passes through her projection.  In a well-programmed nod to physics her clothes get “wet,” stick to her skin.LIGHTNING FIRES ABOVE.  Joi does not flinch.  Only flickers.K raises his coat to cover the rain.  Joi stays his hand.JOIStay like this.  The light catches your skin.  You look like me.  If you’re not too cold...He’s not.  Stays wet.JOI (cont’d)I’m so happy when I’m with you.KYou don’t have to say that.Joi “takes” his hand.  Static heightened by the conductive water clinging to his skin.
